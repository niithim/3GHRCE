 CMS Skilled Nursing Facility Data Pipeline
This project automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of multiple Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) datasets from the  
   [CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services)] (https://data.cms.gov/) portal. 
It fetches data from both **API-based** and **CSV-based** datasets, processes them into structured format using Pandas, and stores them into a local MySQL database.
